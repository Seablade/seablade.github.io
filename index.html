So this is the start of work to start a new blog.  The thought process
is something like this&hellip;
</p>
<p>
"Hey I should write an article on this!&hellip; but I don't have anywhere
to put it and really don't want to create it at the moment"
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">It Begins&hellip;</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
So far this blog is generated by Org-Mode Publish, in a basic form,
and hosted on Github, served via Github pages.  Originally I was
looking into bootstrap, but found it was just to difficult to modify
the css into doing what I wanted instead of what it wanted.
</p>
<p>
That being said, I ended up on Skeleton for something nice and
lightweight, but still had issues with div classes etc. not lining up
with what was expected.  As a result a tiny bit of javascript was
added merely to encapsulate various elements.  Given that I had to do
this with skeleton, I now wonder if maybe I shouldn't have just done
this with bootstrap as well&hellip;
</p>
<p>
Oh well, live and learn.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Still to come</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
Next up is to look into organization of content and start writing some
basic content.  Along with this I need to look into using org's new
RSS backend to possibly create an rss feed for the site, or at least
the blog sometime, but I am not hugely worried about that honestly.
